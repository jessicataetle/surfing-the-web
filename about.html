        <p class="sub-title">VOTING & DISINFORMATION -> SURFING THE WEB</p>
        <p class="paragraph">While misinformation has always existed in some form since the beginning of mass media in the United States, the escalation of misinformation’s influence on the 2020 Presidential Election was unseen before.
            Research shows that in the months leading up to the election and directly after, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/03/facebook-misinformation-nyu-study/">articles from companies that have a reputation for spreading disinformation
                 got six times the amount of likes and shares on Facebook in comparison with articles from reputable sources such as CNN</a>. 
                 While the increase of misinformation on social media raises concerns, research suggests that it only affects a small margin of voters. 
                 According to research, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/us-election-nears-researchers-are-following-trail-fake-news ">80% of misinformation on Twitter was focused on about 1% of users</a>. 
                 However, even though misinformation reaches a small pool of voters, this could still be detrimental to the outcome of close elections. For instance, Brian Kemp won the last gubernatorial election in Georgia in 2018 
                 by 0.4% of the vote. According to exit polls, <a>about 28% of those who voted were undecided as of a month before, so misinformation could heavily sway the outcome of this elections</a>. From our research, we decided to focus on independent voters that make up a sizable portion of these undecided voters, and we also found that the largest demographic of independent voters are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/03/14/political-independents-who-they-are-what-they-think/">men under the age of fifty</a>. Because misinformation is such a threat to swaying the upcoming 2022 Georgia gubernatorial election through these voters, we decided to focus on them as our target demographic.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In order to reach this audience, we decided to format our design around reaching this target demographic. From our research, we found that <a href="https://financesonline.com/video-game-demographic-statistics/">64% of people who play video games in the United States are between the ages of 18 and 54, and 59% of all video game players in the United States are male</a>. Because of this affinity of our chosen audience for video games, we decided to create a game in order to appeal to this demographic. Furthermore, while it may seem appealing to use social media to reach our audience with our mode of interference for disinformation and misnformation, <a href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/what-is-an-echo-chamber/1/">these social media sites are known for creating “echo chambers”</a>  because of a user’s tendency to lean on confirmation bias and interact with posts that align with the user’s opinions and do not expose them to other sources of information, so our target audience maybe hard to reach. In addition, another risk with performing our interference with misinformation via social media is it will not specifically target Georgia voters, which is a key aspect of our target audience as these independent Georgia voters will determine the gubernatorial election. In order to combat these disadvantages, we want to put our game into a physical space in Georgia that men under 50 are likely to frequent such as a sports bar so that we will have a better chance of our misinformation interference game reaching this audience.</p>
